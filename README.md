# Bitburner
Collection of scripts for the amazing programming game, Bitburner ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/), [Web](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/))

## Indexer
It's scan-analyze, but it traverses *every* server.

## Networth
If you're a stock market fiend, this will give you a floating tail window that will tell you your total $$$, ie. stock market value + cash

## Sellallstocks
It sells all your stocks

## Stocks
A pretty basic (and very messy) automatated stock trading script
